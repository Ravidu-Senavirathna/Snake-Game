'''
The Player class inherits from pygame.sprite.Sprite, 
which allows it to be used in conjunction with Pygame's sprite groups and collision detection features.

Main methods of the Player class include:
    - __init__: Initializes the player with a starting position and creates a rectangle for collision detection 
    - draw: Draws the player on the screen as a rectangle filled with the specified color
    - move: Moves the player by a certain amount in the x and y directions and updates the player's rect position accordingly   

The class also includes methods: 
    - getting the player's rect for collision detection and boundary checking 
    - getting and setting the player's position.
